# ActionSchema

With [ActionSchema](https://actionschema.com) you can build prompt-chains in spreadsheets. ActionSchema aggregates Generative AI models across all modalities and combines it with SERP and web-scraping.

It differs from most prompt IDE's because its main interface is a spreadsheet instead, and with that it simplifies working with data, because you can immediately see how altering your prompt-chain affects your dataset.
